        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>Every question has 5 options, you can pick only one of them. Sure, at times more than one option could be considered correct..But you will have to dig deep if you want the highest score.
            The best answer will award you 10 points. The worst, -10. Make sure you're happy with your pick, there is no going back. At the end you'll know what kind of muggle you are. But don't be 
            too worried, if you're unhappy with it, you can always start over. Good luck now!
